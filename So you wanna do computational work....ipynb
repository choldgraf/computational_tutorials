In reality, computational models are a set of algorithmic tools for doing cool stuff with data, a set of high-level languages for carefully laying out what those algorithms do, and a set of high-level languages for carrying out those algorithms on computers.  You'll need to work on understanding all three (intuition, math, and programming) in order to be a good computational scientist.\n",

      "1. Start learning some python, because it is free, it is the most flexible, and because there is a HUGE community of pythonistas out there that can provide help.\n",

      "1. Go through the equations for these models.  Be able to explain each part of the equation, and what it does intuitively.\n",
      "1. Find a package that carries out these equations, look through its code and see how the code relates to the equation, as well as how the data you have in python can be transformed to inputs in this equation.\n",

Get to the point where someone could throw a random dataset at you, and you could figure out whether this model applies and how you'd use this approach on it.\n",
